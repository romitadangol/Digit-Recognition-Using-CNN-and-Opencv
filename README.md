# Digit-Recognition-Using-CNN-and-Opencv
This project builds and evaluates a CNN for digit classification using Opencv. The main goal is to train a model that can classify digits. The dataset consists of 10 classes from digits 0-9 which have over 1000 images per class which are preprocessed, resized and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
